Frankly speaking, the method operates on two kind of arguments. The first one is a template with a set of placeholders targeted for substitution and the second one is a list of pairs consisting of a placeholder name and its value that will be used for the substitution. Let's take a look at the `BasicTemplate` class, which is delivered with the QCG-PilotJob Executor API:"
