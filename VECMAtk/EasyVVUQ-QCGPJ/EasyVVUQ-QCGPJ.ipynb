    "In order to keep the conformance with the basic *EasyVVUQ* tutorial we will show the same workflow as it was used in that tutorial's use-case, i.e. the scenario of Polynomial Chaos Expansion for a model of a cooling coffee cup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cooling Coffee Cup model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to recall the idea of the scenario, let us shortly describe the physical basics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses Newton's law of cooling to\n",
    "evolve the temperature, $T$, over time ($t$) in an environment at\n",
    "$T_{env}$ :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\\kappa (T(t) -T_{env})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\kappa$ characterizes the rate at which the coffee cup\n",
    "transfers heat to the environment. In this example we will analyze this\n",
    "model using the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) UQ algorithm. We will\n",
    "use a constant initial temperature $T_0 = 95 ^\\circ\\text{C}$, and vary\n",
    "$\\kappa$ and $T_{env}$ using a uniform distribution in the ranges\n",
    "$0.025-0.075$ and $15-25$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EasyVVUQ Script Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was already said, the origin of the scenario for this tutorial is the UQ analysis of cooling cofee cup model delivered as a primary *EasyVVUQ* example. \n",
    "Once the *EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ* sources are checked-out from GitHub, the python code for the model is available in `EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ/tests/cooling/cooling_model.py` and the template used for the encoding of input for this model is available in `EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ/tests/cooling/cooling.template`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the approach we took to integrate *EasyVVUQ* with *QCG Pilot Job Manager* is considerably non-intrusive, the original *EasyVVUQ* workflow for the scenario (the one without *QCG-PilotJob*) requires only slight modifications to run with the *QCG-PilotJob* mechanism. The crucial ammendment introduced into the current tutorial, is the replacement of basic way of execution of *EasyVVUQ* tasks by *EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ* *encoding* and *execution* routines to perform most demanding computations using the *QCG-PilotJob* system. \n",
    "In the rest of this notebook the whole ammended workflow is presented, however in order to not disturb your attention from the main topic of this tutorial, we concentrate on the part related to *EasyVVUQ-QCGPJ* code itself. If you want to know something more about other parts of the workflow please refer to the *EasyVVUQ* documentation or to the basic *EasyVVUQ* tutorial. "
